This console application can be used to find Youtube channels based on certain keywords and it also filters them based on the number of subscribers. It outputs the results as a .md file in the same folder as the exe.

This project was started because of this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gere3c/my_first_game_had_more_than_45m_views_on_youtube/) and it handles the third step to be precise.

**Requirements:**

You simply need a Youtube API key for it to work. Tutorial on how to get one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLAZUTbc97I).


**How to install:**

1. Download the "YCF.zip" file
2. Extract the "YCF" folder
3. Run the .exe and follow the instructions that are given.

(Note: The "config.txt" is important, keep it in the same folder as the .exe)
